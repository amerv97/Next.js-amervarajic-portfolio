                Biography
              </h2>
              <p className="font-medium ">
                - Hi, I'm CodeBucks, a web developer and UI/UX designer with a
                passion for creating beautiful, functional, and user-centered
                digital experiences. With 4 years of experience in the field. I
                am always looking for new and innovative ways to bring my
                clients' visions to life.
              </p>
              <p className="font-medium my-4">
                - I believe that design is about more than just making things
                look pretty â€“ it's about solving problems and creating
                intuitive, enjoyable experiences for users.
              </p>
              <p className="font-medium ">
                - Whether I'm working on a website, mobile app, or other digital
                product, I bring my commitment to design excellence and
                user-centered thinking to every project I work on. I look
                forward to the opportunity to bring my skills and passion to
                your next project.
              </p>
